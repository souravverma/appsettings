# ALIAS MAPPING

Because <a href="/posts/8f87c65a0a-postgresqls-max-identifier-length-is-63-bytes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PostgreSQL's Max Identifier Length Is 63 Bytes</a> 
we have been forced to rename the aliases so that they are not truncated.


**For a better understanding of the code, here's what aliases are :**

| Alias                 |  | Correspondence        |

| b3DExt                |->| branch3DExtremity     |
